    description: | 
      A Spring Boot app that provides a Web UI developed through Thymeleaf Template Resolver and REST end points through Spring REST.
      It used Spring JPA to connect to the databases. There are three database options to choose from, H2 and MySQL. 
      You should be able to switch between H2 and MySQL by changing the active profile in the application.yml file. 
      This application will expose the H2 Console through http://localhost:8080/h2-console/ and the swagger documenation through http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
    version: 2.0.0
